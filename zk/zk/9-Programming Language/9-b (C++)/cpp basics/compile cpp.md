# compile 

假设我们要用g++编译一个程序

`g++ -std=c++23 main.cpp -o main`

- g++ : This is the compiler command
- -std=c++23 : This specifies the c++ version you want to compile in
- main.cpp : This is the source file
- -o : This means that you are going to give a specific name to your executable
- main : In this case it is main

`g++ -std=c++23 main.cpp` This is also valid, your executable will be something like a.out
